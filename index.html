<p>The last year has been extremely difficult for myself and my family. A lot of things were lost, including all the data for my site. I am currently in the process of starting over.
    I still want to make sure the resources I have put together are available for those that need it. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at the email at the bottom of the page. Thank you.</p>

    <h2>Where am I</h2>

<p>Did you meet me at Start Up Week? Are you wondering why a developer has such a sad page?!?! I am wondering the same thing, but when I went to StartUp week, I had no idea
    it would be inspiring me to really restart Midwest Nerd Chick. I am currently working on a much prettier site that reflects what I am working on, but for now, 
    this basic HTML page is what I got.</p>

    <p>A Software Product Owner who has decided to help businesses, groups, and non-profits understand how to accommodate employees with disabilities, 
        both physical and mental, how to talk to employees who are part of the LGBTQIA+ 
        community, and how to make the work environment open and friendly to all religions.</p> 

<p?The Alphabet Project is here to make sure that everyone has a spot at the table in your organization. Not only will it help 
       improves employee retention, but it will also help employees really enjoy where they are, which will improve their overall performance. 
       I know many of you are wanting to add this to your company culture, but it gets put on the back burner, time and time again. 
       This is how I help and be that liaison and guide so you can say all members of the alphabet have a place in your organization.</p> 

<p>With 39 years of mental disabilities, 10 years as a non-christian, 8 years being part of the rainbow community, and 6 years with a 
    physical disability, I have been at so many jobs that I loved, but due to not feeling like I had a voice or that who I am or my 
    struggles would be listened to, I left. This doesn't have to be and I hope I can help your organization learn to be open and inclusive.</p>
