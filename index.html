<p>The last year has been extremely difficult for myself and my family. A lot of things were lost, including all the data for my site. I am currently in the process of starting over.
    I still want to make sure the resources I have put together are available for those that need it. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at the email at the bottom of the page. Thank you.</p>

    <h2>Creating a real impact in your community</h2>

<p>For whatever conviction you have, if you do nothing with it, it has no purpose. You can be mad at the world, mad at current politics, 
    or mad at people, but if you are unwilling to bring yourself to actually act in a positive way, nothing will change. I know this as I have all too often 
    been angry. If you read through my old blogs, you will see that theme. And about 6 months ago,</p>

    <p>My goal as the Midwest Nerd Chick is to provide a place for STEAM passionate people to share their events, 
        businesses, community outreach opportunities, and non-profits to the City of Wichita. All while sharing what it is like 
        to be one of those people myself and the struggles that led me here and what I am currently facing. This isnâ€™t going to be a place of hate or 
        rage, well hopefully not TOO much at least, but a place that you can go to when you are mad. That when you are so mad that you feel like there is no 
        hope for humanity, come here and find that hope. Find that group, that business that needs your anger, turned to energy, to help them make that positive change you are so angry to 
        see. I hope I can help inspire you in one way or another to go out and make a change.</p>
